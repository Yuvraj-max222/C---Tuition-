/*Write a program to enter the marks of a student in four subjects. Calculate the total, aggregate and display the grade obtained by the
student. If the student scores aggregate is greater than 75%, then the grade is DISTINCTION. If the aggregate is 60 >= and < 75, then the
grade is FIRST DIVISION. If the aggregate is 50 >= and < 60, then the grade is SECOND DIVISION. If the aggregate is 40 >= and Ï‰50, then
the grade is THIRD DIVISION and if lower than that, it'll be marked FAILED.*/
